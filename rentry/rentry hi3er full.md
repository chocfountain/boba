# -> Difference between Kalpas1 and Kalpas2: <-
-> By: Butter#2252 <-

Kalpas 2 core makes you lose 5k Hp or more to give you a 40% boost from kalpas signets (increases to 8k hp lost and 80% boost from kalpas with 25% bonus hp signet). Any healing you get turns into more hp for the hp cap, meaning more hp for kalpas core two (which can further increase the 80% boost to 100% with hp% signet)

# -> Difference between Su1 and Su2: <-
#####-> **Su 1 vs Su 2 enhanced only** <-
-> By: Butter#2252 <-

**Su 1 enhanced signets:**
Maxim of Anitya: enemies hit by karma wheels can not regenerate sheilds for 3 seconds.

Maxim of Anatman: the next attack with in 8 seconds by an enemy hit by karma wheel has that attack lose 50% total damage. 

Maxim of Santam: karma wheels deal 100% bonus damage to  shielded and  500% additional adaptive damage to unshielded enemies.

Maxim of Anitya does not remove shields it just makes the enemy not able to recover them which is only useful against heimdel and that it.  Maxim of Anatman looks good but then you remember that it only affects ONE attack and since most enemies have multi hit moves you are still going to take the full damage of the other oh and this doesn’t work with fu hua core 2 enhanced signet worldly troubles. Maxim of Santam is the only good one as it’s more damage but that’s it.

——————————

**Su 2 enhanced signets:**

Dictum of Anitya: for every debuff in the enemy Bodhi open eye will deal 150% more damage

Dictum of Anatman: Bodhi open eye debuffs last 3 seconds longer and for every debuff on the enemy, they receive 5% more total damage taken from the enemy

Dictum of Santam: Bodhi open eye will apply 3 random debuffs for 3 seconds

Dictum is the king of enemy total damage taken as the trance debuff which is part of the core is a debuff it already means anatman makes them have 5% more. Then santam applies 3 random of the following debuffs (stun, paralyze, Ignite, freeze, impair, weaken, attack slow and move slow) that’s 7 more debuffs! Now anatman and anitya also counts anything that is labeled as a debuff so this includes: Trance, Intoxication (eden 1), weapon skill debuffs, shield shattered (Carole), HoT mark, Analyzed (HoR), Coma (HoS), Immobilized (jailer, AE ult), etc. with all of that said you can see how good Su 2 is with its enhanced than Su 1. Also with all 8 debuffs the enemy has gained 40% more total damage taken. And that’s level 1. At level 3 that’s 64% damage taken.
